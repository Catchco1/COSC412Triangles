For the database:
 - The model is expecting a database calls "bands" with a collection called "bandsCollection"

There are 2 pages:
 1. The default page, http://localhost:3000 currently just displays "Welcome to Music Suggester" 
 2. A page that queries the database for band information. It will display this in JSON format in the browser for now. Accessed at http://localhost:3000/api/bands
